This was my final project in my introduction to mechatronics class.

In short, it was a motor control project with current and position feedback loops. I built a PI controller for current into the motor and a PID controller for the position of the motor.

The microcontroller we used was a PIC32. More details about the components and the results can be requested. My contact is charlescheng2024@u.northwestern.edu.
