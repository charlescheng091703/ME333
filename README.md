This was my final project in my introduction to mechatronics class.

In short, it was a motor control project with current and position feedback loops. I built a PI controller for current into the motor and a PID controller for the position of the motor. The microcontroller we used was a PIC32. 

I uploaded four demonstration videos onto Google Drive. The files (> 100 MB) can be downloaded from Google Drive. Here's the link to the Drive folder: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MGJbufXbI904bFWfQCvseTJSvbxl9VZ1?usp=sharing. 

More details about the components and the results can be requested. My contact is charlescheng2024@u.northwestern.edu.
